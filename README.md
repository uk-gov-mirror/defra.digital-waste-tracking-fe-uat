## Local Development

### Requirements

#### Node.js

Please install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) `>= v22.13.1` and [npm](https://nodejs.org/) `>= v9`. You will find it
easier to use the Node Version Manager [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

To use the correct version of Node.js for this application, via nvm:

```bash
nvm use
```

### Setup

Clone the repository and change into this project directory:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd digital-waste-tracking-fe-uat
```

Install application dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create a local environment file from the template:

```bash
cp env.sh.template env.sh
```

Update `env.sh` with the values for the environment you want to test against. Use `env.sh.template` as the source of required variable names. Do not commit `env.sh`; it is ignored by git because it contains secrets.

When running from a local machine against protected CDP backend APIs, also set:

```bash
export xapikey=<cdp-api-key>
```

### Running local tests

Start application you are testing on the url specified in `baseUrl` [wdio.local.conf.js](wdio.local.conf.js)

```bash
npm run test:local
```

### Debugging local tests

```bash
npm run test:local:debug
```

## Production

### Running the tests

Tests are run from the CDP-Portal under the Test Suites section. Before any changes can be run, a new docker image must be built, this will happen automatically when a pull request is merged into the `main` branch.
You can check the progress of the build under the actions section of this repository. Builds typically take around 1-2 minutes.

The results of the test run are made available in the portal.

## Requirements of CDP Environment Tests

1. Your service builds as a docker container using the `.github/workflows/publish.yml`
   The workflow tags the docker images allowing the CDP Portal to identify how the container should be run on the platform.
   It also ensures its published to the correct docker repository.

2. The Dockerfile's entrypoint script should return exit code of 0 if the test suite passes or 1/>0 if it fails

3. Test reports should be published to S3 using `npm run report:publish`, which runs `./bin/publish-tests.sh`

## Running on GitHub

Alternatively you can run the test suite as a GitHub workflow.
Test runs on GitHub are not able to connect to the CDP Test environments. Instead, they run the tests against a version of the services running in docker.
A docker compose `compose.yml` is included as a starting point, which includes the databases (mongodb, redis) and infrastructure (localstack) pre-setup.

Steps:

1. Edit the compose.yml to include your services.
2. Modify the scripts in docker/scripts to pre-populate the database, if required and create any localstack resources.
3. Test the setup locally with `docker compose up` and `npm run test:github`
4. Set up the workflow trigger in `.github/workflows/journey-tests`.

By default, the provided workflow will run when triggered manually from GitHub or when triggered by another workflow.

If you want to use the repository exclusively for running docker composed based test suites consider displaying the publish.yml workflow.

## BrowserStack

Two wdio configuration files are provided to help run the tests using BrowserStack in both a GitHub workflow (`wdio.github.browserstack.conf.js`) and from the CDP Portal (`wdio.browserstack.conf.js`).
They can be run from npm using the `npm run test:browserstack` (for running via portal) and `npm run test:github:browserstack` (from GitHib runner).
See the CDP Documentation for more details.

## DWT Admin tool UI

- **Backend** (`GetOrganisationsByDateRange.feature`): tests the new Organisation Backend API that returns organisations registered between a start and end date.
- **Admin tool UI**: `Login.feature` (admin portal sign-in) and `WasteOrganisationsReport.feature` (report that uses the organisations API to list organisations and download CSV for a date range).
  - The MongoDB seed script (`test/utils/test-data-organisations.js`) must be run before the report tests. In shared environments (dev, test) this only needs to be done once; for local runs, insert the data into MongoDB before running the tests.
- **BrowserStack**: run all admin-tool UI features tagged `@browserstack-admin-tool` with `npm run test:browserstack:admin-tool` (desktop browsers only). Default `npm run test:browserstack` is unchanged.
