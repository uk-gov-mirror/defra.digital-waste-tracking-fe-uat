Feature: View API Code
  As a waste receiver using the service
  I want to manage the API code for the selected business
  So that I can use it to connect my software to the DWT service.

  @env_dev @accessibility
  Scenario: Waste receiver logs in for the first time for a selected business and gets a new active API Code
    Given a user is logged in to the waste receiver registration portal
    And the user navigates to report receipt of waste
    And user selects option to view his api code
    When user is on the View API Code page
    Then user should see the "active" API Code for the selected business
    And user should be able to use the new API code to submit waste movements

  @env_dev @env_test @issue=DR-60
  Scenario: Local authority should be able to manage their API code
    Given a user is logged in to the waste receiver registration portal using a "Gov UK" account as a local authority
    And the user navigates to report receipt of waste
    And user selects option to view his api code
    When user is on the View API Code page
    Then user should see the "active" API Code for the selected business
    And user should be able to use the new API code to submit waste movements

  @env_test @accessibility
  Scenario Outline: Waste receiver with a pre-existing active API Code logs in via "<account_type>" and gets the same active API Code

    And user selects option to view his api code
    When user is on the View API Code page
    Then user should see the "active" API Code for the selected business

      | Gov UK             |
      | Government Gateway |

  @env_test
  Scenario: Waste receiver with multiple businesses can submit waste movements using each business's API code
    Given a multi-business user is logged in via "Gov UK"
    And the user views the API code for the selected business
    And user should be able to use the API code to submit waste movements
    When the user switches to a different business
    Then the user should see a different "active" API code for that business
